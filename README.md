# Penguin Engineering: Coding Exercise
[Programming Exercise Write-up](docs/programming_exercise_writeup.md)

## Getting Started:

[Running the Program and Running Tests](docs/running_program.md)

## Penguin Events:

The input to your program is a text file containing a list of Penguin events from a completed simulation. Penguin events are events which happen in our system, e.g. when a ride is started or ended. A drop event is when a Penguin is initially put into the simulation. The format of the events is:

| Data        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| timestamp       | Integer        | The time in seconds since the start of the simulation |
| penguin_id       | String        | The id of the associated Penguin vehicle, e.g. JK5T |
| event_type       | String        | The type of the event is one of START_RIDE, END_RIDE, DROP |
| x       | Double        | The x coordinate of the location of where the event happened in the simulation |
| y       | Double        | The y coordinate of the location of where the event happened in the simulation |
| user_id       | Integer        | The id of the associated user or NULL if the event does not have an associated user |
   
Each column is separated by a comma (,) and each line represents a single event. The list is ordered by time starting with the first event that happened.

## Goal:

The goal of the program is to parse a list of such events and print out to the command line (stdout) answers to the following questions. A list of sample events of one completed simulation is sent as a separate file, so you can test your code with them. Assume each question has exactly one valid answer, each penguin has been dropped off as its first event and all rides have a start and end event.

## Questions:

- [x] 1. What is the total number of Penguin vehicles dropped off in the simulation?
- [x] 2. Which Penguin ends up the farthest away from its drop location? What is the distance?
- [x] 3. Which Penguin has traveled the longest distance in total on all of its rides? How far is it?

## Bonus:

- [x] 4. Which user has paid the most? How much is it? The cost of a ride is $1 to start and $0.15 for every started minute. If the ride lasts less than 1 minute, the cost is $0.
For example:
- Ride time 98 seconds = $1.30
- Ride time 153 seconds = $1.45
- Ride time 52 seconds = $0.00
- [ ] 5. Which Penguin has the longest wait time between two rides? How many seconds is it?
- [ ] 6. What is the average speed travelled across all rides?

at long as we know you've got a busy schedule. However, we want to understand more about you as an engineer so feel free to express your craft as you see fit. We will, however, time box you to one week from the time you receive the test.

Please complete all three questions as these are required, but if youâ€™re up for a challenge, we are also offering up a few bonus questions.
