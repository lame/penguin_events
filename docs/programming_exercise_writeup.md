Thank you for your continued interest in Penguin!

This at-home coding challenge is an opportunity for you to write some clean code that shows us how you use data structures to solve simple algorithmic problems.

  * You may use any programming language of your choice.
  * Use your preferred IDE or editor and whatever tooling you're comfortable with.
  * Feel free to use whatever references you'd like, including Google.
  * When you’re finished, make sure your code is committed to the repo with instructions on how to run it.
  * Please press the submit button in the top-right corner in Py to let us know you're done.
  * Your solution should be self-contained and not require additional software to run it.

We don't expect this challenge to take that long as we know you've got a busy schedule. However, we want to understand more about you as an engineer so feel free to express your craft as you see fit. We will, however, time box you to one week from the time you receive the test.

Please complete all three questions as these are required, but if you’re up for a challenge, we are also offering up a few bonus questions.
